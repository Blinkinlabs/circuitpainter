Circuit Painter

Circuit painter is a creative coding tool for making functional printed
circuit boards.

Inspired by the simplifed drawing language of Processing, this tool provides
an environment for designing PCBs using basic geometric shapes such as lines,
arcs, and polygons. The tool maintains a drawing 'context' that applies a
translation and rotation matrix to all calls, making it simple to replicate
circuit features at differnt points across a circuit board. Functional PCB
components such as part footprints can also be placed, and connected together
logically using 'nets'.

Circuit painter works as a front end / wrapper for `KiCad's pcbnew <https://www.kicad.org>`_.

For more backgrond on the project, see `Matt's Hackaday Berlin talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XV9PSsmMkk>`_ about Circuit painter.

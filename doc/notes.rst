Additional Notes

--------

* Cooler examples: Fractals such as Apollonian gasket, Sierpinski triangles, Fibonacci spirals?
* Font configuration: Configure a text-type, and have it auto-apply whenever text is drawn (`similar to this <https://processing.org/reference/textFont_.html>`_)
* Some way to generate schematics, even if they are terrible and just have each component drawn out separtely, with small wires and net names on each port.
* Place components on path: tool for placing evenly-spaced footprints along a path
* 'Fill' region with equally-spaced or patterned components

CircuitPainter is a simplified interface for KiCad's
`PcbNew <https://www.kicad.org/discover/pcb-design/>`_ library. Their library
does all of the heavy lifting in actually making the PCBs.
